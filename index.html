<h1>C🍩ursemunk</h1>
<p>by Annalise, Gabby, and Mikayla</p>
<p>Hello! Welcome to CourseMunk, a visualization about courses at DIS. Every student in the Data Visualization course at DIS answered a survey about the courses they are taking this semester, and we have compiled the results in the parallel coordinate and donut charts below. Based on student experiences, we hope to provide feedback to DIS on the quality, usefulness, enjoyment, and difficulty of their courses.
This may also help future students plan their schedules as well.</p>
<p>Click a slice on the donut to highlight lines on the parallel coordinates chart.</p>
